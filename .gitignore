# You need to be careful about your target dirs and how they interact with git.
# I have made the decision that you probably meant to make a workspace.
#
# I have also deleted the files in the other target folder, since `/target`
# only covers a target directory at the root of the repo.
#
# For workspace, this can stay:
/target
