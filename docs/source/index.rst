Welcome to DynamiXplore!
========================

**A modern, high-performance Python framework for the exploration of dynamical systems.**

`DynamiXplore` provides a comprehensive and user-friendly toolkit for the numerical simulation and analysis of continuous and discrete dynamical systems. By leveraging a powerful Rust backend, it delivers C-level performance for computationally intensive tasks, while maintaining a clean, intuitive, and "Pythonic" API for ease of use.

Whether you are a researcher studying chaotic attractors, an engineer modeling complex feedback systems, or a student learning about non-linear dynamics, `DynamiXplore` provides the tools you need to move from theory to insight.
